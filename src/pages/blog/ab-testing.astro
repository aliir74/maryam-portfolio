  <p>
    Implementing a company-wide A/B testing framework enabled our teams
    to make data-driven decisions and optimize key conversion metrics.
    We started by educating teams on experimentation best practices and
    building easy-to-use tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    We established clear success metrics and a process for analyzing
    results. The framework empowered teams to run their own tests and
    share learnings across the organization.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a result, we saw a 15% uplift in key conversion metrics and
    fostered a culture of continuous improvement and innovation.
