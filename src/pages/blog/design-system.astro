  <p>
    Building a design system from scratch is a transformative process
    for any product team. We began by auditing our existing UI
    components and identifying inconsistencies across products.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our team defined a set of design principles and created a shared
    library of reusable components. We worked closely with engineers to
    ensure seamless integration and documentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The new design system improved development efficiency, ensured brand
    consistency, and empowered teams to deliver a cohesive user
    experience across all products.
