  <p>
    Redesigning a B2B analytics platform is a complex journey that
    requires balancing user needs, business goals, and technical
    constraints. Our team started by conducting in-depth user research
    to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement.
  </p>
  <p>
    We collaborated closely with stakeholders and end-users, iterating
    on wireframes and prototypes. The new design focused on clarity,
    actionable insights, and a modern visual language. We also improved
    performance and accessibility across the platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    The results were clear: user engagement increased by 25%, and task
    completion rates improved by 40%. This project reinforced the value
    of a user-centered approach and cross-functional teamwork.
