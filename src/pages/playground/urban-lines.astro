  <p>
    Modern architecture is a study in lines, angles, and the play of light on surfaces. This building
    in downtown Chicago represents the perfect marriage of form and function, where aesthetic beauty
    serves a practical purpose.
  </p>

  <h2>Finding Beauty in Structure</h2>
  <p>
    What draws me to architectural photography is the challenge of finding unique perspectives on
    structures that thousands of people pass by every day without really seeing. By changing your
    angle, your timing, or your framing, you can reveal something new about even the most familiar
    buildings.
  </p>

  <h3>Compositional Choices</h3>
  <p>
    For this shot, I chose a low angle looking up, emphasizing the building's height and the way
    its lines converge toward the sky. The harsh midday sun created strong shadows that accentuate
    the geometric patterns of the facade.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Focal point:</strong> The intersection of vertical and diagonal lines</li>
    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Light and shadow playing across the surface</li>
    <li><strong>Symmetry:</strong> Balanced composition with centered perspective</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Urban Canvas</h2>
  <p>
    Cities are constantly evolving galleries of design. Each building tells a story about the era
    in which it was built, the vision of its architects, and the needs of its occupants. Through
    photography, we can capture and preserve these moments in the city's ongoing transformation.
