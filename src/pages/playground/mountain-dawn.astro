  <p>
    There's something magical about being on a mountain peak just before sunrise. The world is still,
    quiet, holding its breath as the first rays of light begin to paint the sky in shades of orange
    and pink.
  </p>

  <h2>The Golden Hour</h2>
  <p>
    Photographers often talk about the "golden hour" - that brief period just after sunrise or before
    sunset when the light is soft, warm, and perfect for photography. But there's something even more
    special about the moments just before the sun appears.
  </p>

  <h3>Technical Details</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Sony A7R IV</li>
    <li><strong>Lens:</strong> 24-70mm f/2.8</li>
    <li><strong>Settings:</strong> ISO 100, f/11, 1/125s</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Swiss Alps</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Experience</h2>
  <p>
    This shot was taken after a challenging 3-hour hike in complete darkness. The cold was biting,
    but as the first light began to creep over the horizon, every moment of discomfort was forgotten.
    This is what landscape photography is all about - being in the right place at the right time.

  <p>
    The interplay of light and shadow across the mountain ranges created a sense of depth and scale
    that's difficult to capture in a photograph, but in this moment, everything aligned perfectly.
