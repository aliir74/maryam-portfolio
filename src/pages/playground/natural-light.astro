  <p>
    There's an intimacy to portrait photography that goes beyond technical skill. It's about
    creating a connection with your subject, making them feel comfortable enough to let their
    guard down and show their true self to the camera.
  </p>

  <h2>The Power of Natural Light</h2>
  <p>
    For this session, we worked entirely with natural light streaming through large windows. No
    artificial lights, no reflectors - just the soft, diffused glow of indirect sunlight. This
    approach creates a gentle, flattering illumination that feels organic and authentic.
  </p>

  <h3>Creating Connection</h3>
  <p>
    The key to capturing genuine expressions is creating an environment where the subject forgets
    about the camera. We spent time talking, laughing, and simply being present with each other
    before even picking up the camera.
  </p>

  <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Aperture:</strong> f/1.8 for shallow depth of field</li>
    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Sharp on the eyes, soft bokeh in background</li>
    <li><strong>ISO:</strong> 400 to maintain natural skin tones</li>
    <li><strong>White Balance:</strong> Slightly warm to enhance the golden hour feel</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The soft focus on the background helps direct attention to the subject's face while creating
    a dreamy, ethereal quality. The natural light from the window creates a subtle rim light that
    adds dimension and separates the subject from the background.

    "A portrait is not made in the camera but on either side of it." - Edward Steichen

  <h2>Beyond the Technical</h2>
  <p>
    While understanding camera settings and lighting is important, the real magic in portrait
    photography happens in the connection between photographer and subject. It's about capturing
    a moment, a feeling, a glimpse of someone's authentic self.
