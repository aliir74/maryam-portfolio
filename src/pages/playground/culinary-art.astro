  <p>
    Food photography is about more than just making dishes look appetizing. It's about telling the
    story of the meal - the craftsmanship of the chef, the quality of ingredients, the care that
    went into its creation.
  </p>

  <h2>Styling and Composition</h2>
  <p>
    Every element in this frame was carefully considered. The rustic wooden table provides warmth
    and texture, while the careful placement of garnishes and the drizzle of sauce guides the
    viewer's eye through the composition.
  </p>

  <h3>Lighting Approach</h3>
  <p>
    Soft, directional lighting from the side creates depth and dimension, highlighting the textures
    and colors of the dish. This "hero light" makes the food look fresh, vibrant, and irresistible.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Light Source:</strong> Large softbox positioned at 45 degrees</li>
    <li><strong>Reflector:</strong> White bounce card to fill shadows</li>
    <li><strong>Background:</strong> Simple, complementary colors that don't compete</li>
    <li><strong>Angle:</strong> Slightly elevated, classic food photography perspective</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Art of Food Styling</h2>
  <p>
    Working with food requires speed and precision. You have a limited window to capture the dish
    at its peak - when the steam is still rising, the sauce is glossy, and everything looks fresh.
    This shot was the result of collaboration between chef, stylist, and photographer.

  <p>
    The goal is to create an image that makes the viewer not just see the food, but almost taste
    it. It's about evoking sensation and desire through visual means.
